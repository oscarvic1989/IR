wget -r -np -nH --cut-dirs=3 -R index.html http://hostname/aaa/bbb/ccc/ddd/

It will download all files and subfolders in ddd directory:
recursively (-r),

not going to upper directories, like ccc/â€¦ (-np),

not saving files to hostname folder (-nH),

but to ddd by omitting first 3 folders aaa, bbb, ccc (--cut-dirs=3)

excluding index.html files (-R index.html)
